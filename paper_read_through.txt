intro
maybe remove the feature selection part or reword in the intro. Several points are wrong or strangely
worded or unjustified, and it may not be the main point.



Hypothesis 1- The time window feature method will generally be more useful for classifying longer 
attacks. Relatedly, 

Hypothesis 1.1 - Assuming 1 is correct, longer time windows will generally be more useful because 
shorter attacks will often have less network traffic samples, therefore will be naturally less useful
in situations where time window features are calculated over windows of smaller size containing less sample
, thing ping of death. Therefore the longer time windows will generally be 
selected as more important.
Reword above, thats terrible

Bad transition with "In addition, the size of the attack may affect the optimal time window for feature calculation. 
In this paper, we explore these widely unanswered questions." Remove or reword.

A graph that counts the occurences of different optimally selected time windows to see which are most
important. 

To address the question of 
"Will optimal time window feature sets contain multiple time windows of a single feature, 
using versions based on both short and long term history?" find at least one example where the f1 score
decreases from one round to the next at the elimination of a "redundant" feature.
