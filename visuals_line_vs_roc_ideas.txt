Line graph of length of attack vs percentage of that attack increased relative to baseline (if the basline is 7 percent and the predicted is 14 percent, then the score will be double or 2, and the max of the y axis is infinite). You could also just take the percentage itself and the max of the y axis is 1.
specifically the length of the attack vs percentage will have an X axis that will not be exactly incremental. For repeats in length of attack, take the average (eg. multiple 1s).

Have an ROC where the x is in the same increments and have the y be the percentage of attacks that have a higher score than the baseline.
repeat this for each attack type, and do one final with all.

Find the pearson correlation coeff of the x axis length of attack and y axis percentage increase (or regular percent) for each attack. This will show how much time lengths of attacks matters. Doing correlation coeff will require that duplicate lengths (i.e. 1 second) are each plotted so that each point has an equal weight.
The positive correlation of Attack length and TPR provides a mathematical rationale that the time window features are better at predicting longer DOS attacks.

Perhaps the line graph should be the relative percentage and the pearson correlation coef should be the actual percentage (or both)

By calculating all of the attacks with a percentage of 0 divided by the total number of attacks, you will get the percentage of attacks that were correctly predicted as such.


Argue that F1 was used as the feature selection method, but it is not necessarily the best evaluation method.
