Line graph of length of attack vs percentage of that attack increased relative to baseline
specifically the length of the attack vs percentage will have an X axis that will not be exactly incremental. For repeats in length of attack, take the average (eg. multiple 1s).

Have an ROC where the x is in the same increments and have the y be the percentage of attacks that have a higher score than the baseline.
repeat this for each attack type, and do one final with all.
