        #the nature of time windows presents an interesting problem with metrics compared to usual classification tasks. A simple one to one comparison of prediction to label for each individual second does not completely capture the effectiveness of attack classification when an attack is a sequence of seconds, not a single second.
        #also important is the idea that ANY value of an attack window is classified as an attack (a single flagged event in an entire window may be enough for a sec analyst to check for (and discover) an attack). Of course this method alone neither takes into account reducing FPs and it does not give weight to the normal true positive rate. (e.g. if an attack is 1000 seconds, and only 1 sec is classified as such, a sec analyst would (reasonably) be more likely to overlook it than if 700 / 1000 are classified as an attack in the same window).
        #in other words, it looks more like a false positive. We want a measure that considers the total attacks correctly flagged, the percentage of individual attack seconds classified as such, and the individual regular seconds incorrectly classified as an attack. All three of these measures are important and impact the real world performance of an IDS, and any useful measure of an IDS should consider all three.
        #we want all of these things to be considered together and give us a measure between 0 and 1
        #accuracy alone is a poor predictor of IDS performance [cite base rate fallacy paper]
        
        #Factors for successful IDS metric: 
        #1 perAttackTPR: we want to maximize number of attacks classified as such (with even 1 packet correctly labelled in the entire attack) (domain specific) (gives each attack equal weight) (every attack is important to classify as such)
        #2 TNR: we want to minimize the percentage of false positives (equiv. maximize TNR: (1 - FPR) == TNR) (Regular traffic has an attack prediction.) (all false positives are bad bc of base rate fallacy) (the more, the worse)
        ####get rid of? 3: we want to maximize the average percentage of seconds correctly classified as an attack for each attack, which is equivalent to getting TPR (per attack basis) (this measure gives all attacks equal weight) (threshold)
        #4 TPR: we want to maximize the overall average percentage of true positives (eqiv: total number of correct attack seconds classified as such) (this gives larger attacks more weight (prob good for our purposes)) (per attack accuracy) (larger attacks are more relevant to time-based attacks and therefore should have more weight given to them)
       
        
        #we need a measure which gives all attacks weight, gives longer attacks more weight (time relevant), and penalizes false positives
        #in the future, experimentation can be done to consider the optimal weights given to each of these
